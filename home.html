   <p>
    Drawfee is an art YouTube channel that has been around since 2014 and have amassed a following of over 1.5 million <br>subscribers. The premise of 
	their channel is they take prompts/suggestions from the comments of their videos and use <br>them to make dumb drawings in later episodes. Drawfee is 
	very much a channel of artists just having fun drawing and <br>sharing that love of drawing and comedy with its audience. Drawfee began as just Nathan 
	and Caldwell but now consists <br>of Nathan, Jacob, Julia, Karina, and David. The Drawfee crew where laid off from CHMedia, a company they were employed 
	<br>by to make Drawfee as well as other illustration jobs, at the beginning of 2020, however due to the huge support from the <br>community and their fans, 
	they were able to go independent and have been creating quality videos since.
