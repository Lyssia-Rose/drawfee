   <p>
    Drawfee is an art YouTube channel that has been around since 2014 and have amassed a following of over 1.5 million <br>subscribers. 
	The premise of their channel is they take prompts/suggestions from the comments of their videos and use <br>them to make dumb 
	drawings in later episodes. Drawfee is very much a channel of artists just having fun drawing and <br>sharing that love of drawing 
	and comedy with its audience. Drawfee began as just <a href="people.html#Nathan"><b>Nathan</b></a> and <a href="people.html#Caldwell">
	<b>Caldwell</b></a> but now consists <br>of <a href="people.html#Nathan"><b>Nathan</b></a>, <a href="people.html#Jacob"><b>Jacob</b></a>, 
	<a href="people.html#Julia"><b>Julia</b></a>, <a href="people.html#Karina"><b>Karina</b></a>, and <a href="people.html#David"><b>David</b></a>. 
	The Drawfee crew where laid off from CHMedia, a company they were <br>employed by to make Drawfee as well as other illustration jobs, 
	at the beginning of 2020, however due to the huge <br>support from the community and their fans, they were able to go independent and have 
	been creating quality videos <br>since.
