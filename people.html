      Nathan is the co-founder of Drawfee, alongside <a href="#Caldwell">Caldwell</a>, making him the longest running artist on Drawfee. 
      As a <br>self-proclaimed Gamer, Nathan is a Pokémon master and as such can draw any Pokémon from memory with 
	  <br><i>extreme accuracy</i>. He is very good at imitating others art styles as shown in their drawing in different styles 
	  challenges, <br>however this doesn’t take away from the fact he is a great artist in his own right. Just don’t give him 
	  tomatoes.

      Julia is loved and defended by the fans of Drawfee and is an exceptional artist. She tends to be the last one to draw <br>in an 
	  episode due to her innate ability to exceed any expectations you may have about what she will draw. This has <br>gained her the nickname 
	  ‘Monster Mom’ with her first monster child being Spheal, however she is also known for <br>summoning the most handsome men using her 
	  <i>summoning runes</i>.

      Drawfee has become an archive of how much Jacob has improved as an artist over the years after he was asked to <br>join by Caldwell. He is 
	  considered the bad boy of Drawfee and likes to take hard stances/questionable opinions on <br>subjects such as <i>“nothing should be 
	  underground”</i> and <i>“I don’t think math exists”</i>. Jacob’s partner is <a href="#Julia">Julia Lepetit</a> <br>and has a famed rivalry with
	  <a href="#Willie">Willie Muse</a>. He <i>definitely</i> loves the yogi (yogurt).

      Karina is the baby of drawfee who is not only a great artist but an awesome animator with what many, including her <br>fellow hosts, 
	  consider a wild colouring style. She is the resident expert on all things Yugioh and Digimon, however she <br>does not consume media. If she 
	  knows anything about any other media it is because, as stated by <a href="#Jacob">Jacob</a>, she ‘found <br>the front door, went to go through 
	  the backdoor, and then climb halfway through the window’. If you create sincere <br>fanart just for yourself, then Karina believes you are valid.

   <p>
      David is the editor for Drawfee however they have appeared in a few streams and videos. They love anime and musicals, <br>hence their first 
	  episode appearance being ‘Artists draw posters for musicals they’ve never seen’. David works very hard <br>as an editor and is greatly 
	  appreciated by Drawfee and its fans.

      Caldwell is the co-founder of Drawfee, along with <a href="#Nathan">Nathan</a>, however he went to work at Disney a few years ago as <br>well 
	  as on <a href="https://www.naddpod.com/" target="_blank">NADDPOD</a>, a D&D podcast. Caldwell comes back as a guest artist now and again with 
	  great reception. <br>He also created Porfo, who has become a constant call-back and lead to the creation of a cult following for this being 
	  <br>of mass destruction. Caldwell is a great artist and is a very good boy.

      Willie is a recuring guest who is like marmite for the Drawfee fans, they either love him or hate him. He tends to come <br>onto episodes 
	  to provide lyrics for the Drawfee hosts to draw and tell stories about himself and his <i>platonic</i> friend Matt. <br>The lore surrounding 
	  Willie claims that he has no human form and contains power that surpasses that of Porfo. His rival <br>is <a href="#Jacob">Jacob</a> which 
	  lead to the hashtags #TeamWillie and #BurnJacob.

      Tristan is a guest on Drawfee who will provide prompts to do with pop-culture such as marvel, Pokémon, and Thomas <br>the tank engine. With 
	  him the character Lore Librarian tends to appear and has become a fan favourite. The relationship <br>between Tristan and Lore Librarian is 
	  unclear.
